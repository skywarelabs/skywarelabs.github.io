This series is constructed on Lambert Conical Orthomorphic Projection up to 80°and Polar stereographic projection between 80°N and 90°N with scales matching at 80°N. The aeronautical data shown have been kept to a minimum, consistent with the use of the chart for visual air navigation. It includes a section of aerodromes, significant obstacles, elements of the ATS system, prohibited, restricted and danger areas, and radio navigation aids. The chart provides visual air navigation and is also used as a pre-flight planning chart.,Plotting Chart \u2013 ICAO. This series covering the North Atlantic, Western Europe and North Africa, is designated for in-flight Long-Range Navigation and constructed on Mercators projection with simple outline of land areas at a scale of 1:5 000 000. Aeronautical data consists of major International Aerodromes, selected radio navigation Aids, lattices of long-range. Electronic Aids to Navigation FIR, CTA, CTR, reporting points, etc. The chart is designed to provide a means of maintaining a continuous record of the aircraft position.,Aerodrome\/Heliport chart \u2013 ICAO. This chart contains detailed Aerodrome\/heliport data to provide flight crews with information that will facilitate the ground movement of aircraft:,-from the aircraft stand to the runway and,-from the runway to the aircraft stand;,and helicopter movement:,-from the helicopter stand to the touch down and lift-off area and to the final approach and take \u2013off area:,-from the final approach and take-off area to the touch down and lift-off area and to the helicopter stand:,-along helicopter ground and air taxiways and,-along air transit routes, it also provides essential operational information at the aerodrome\/heliport.,Aerodrome Ground Movement Chart \u2013 ICAO. This chart is produced for those aerodromes where, due to congestion of information, details necessary for the ground movement of aircraft along the taxiways to and from the aircraft stands and for the parking\/docking of aircraft cannot be shown with sufficient clarity on the aerodrome\/heliport chart \u2013 ICAO.,Aircraft Parking\/Docking Chart \u2013 ICAO. This chart is produced for those aerodromes where due to the complexity of the terminal facilities, the information to facilitate the ground movement of aircraft between the taxiways and the aircraft stands and parking\/docking of aircraft cannot be shown with sufficient clarity on the aerodrome\/heliport chart-ICAO or the aerodrome ground movement chart \u2013 ICAO.,Aerodrome Obstacle Chart \u2013 ICAO- Type A (operating limitations). This chart contains detailed information on obstacles in the take-off flight path areas of aerodromes. It is shown in plain and profile view. This obstacle information, in combination with an obstacle chart \u2013 ICAO-Type C, provides data necessary to enable an operator to comply with the operating limitations of ICAO Annex 6, parts I and II, Chapter 5.,Aerodrome Obstacle Chart \u2013 ICAO \u2013 Type C. This chart contains obstacle data necessary to enable an operator to develop procedures to comply with the operating limitations of ICAO Annex 6, parts I and II, Chapter 5, with particular reference to information on obstacles that limit the maximum permissible take-off mass. This chart must provide certain obstacle data and type of graphical information covering a distance of 42 Km (24NM) from the aerodrome reference point. Appropriate topographical charts which are available for the area around the airports, if supplemented with \u201Coverprint\u201D obstacle data and other significant aeronautical information should be suitable for use as the topographic base for the AOC \u2013ICAO \u2013Type C.,This chart is not produced if:,-the required obstacle data is included in the AIP,-no significant obstacles exist, and this fact is included in the AIP.,Precision Approach Terrain Chart \u2013 ICAO.

The holding, approach and departure procedures in use are based on those contained in the latest edition of ICAO Doc 8168 - Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS).,1.5.1.2. The holding and approach procedures in use have been based on the values and factors contained in Parts III and IV of Vol. I of the PANS-OPS. The holding patterns shall be entered and flown as indicated below.,1.5.2 Arriving flights,1.5.2.1. IFR flights entering and landing within a terminal control area will be cleared to a specified holding point and instructed to contact approach control at a specified time, level or position. The terms of this clearance shall be adhered to until further instructions are received from approach control. If the clearance limit is reached before further instructions have been received, holding procedure shall be carried out at the level last authorized.,1.5.2.2. Due to the limited airspace available, it is important that the approaches to the patterns and the holding procedures be carried out as precisely as possible. Pilots are strongly requested to inform ATC if for any reason the approach and\/or holding cannot be performed as required.,1.5.3 Departing flights,1.5.3.1. IFR flights departing from controlled aerodromes will receive initial ATC clearance from the local aerodrome control tower. The clearance limit will normally be the aerodrome of destination. IFR flights departing from non-controlled aerodromes must make arrangements with the area control centre concerned prior to take-off.,1.5.3.2.

A radar unit normally operates as an integral part of the parent ATS unit and provides radar service to aircraft, to the maximum extent practicable, to meet the operational requirement. Many factors, such as radar coverage, controller workload and equipment capabilities, may affect these services, and the radar controller shall determine the practicability of providing or continuing to provide radar services in any specific case.,1.6.1.1.2. A pilot will know when radar services are being provided because the radar controller will use the following phraseology... (aircraft call signthis is ...Area\/Approach, radar identified\/or radar contact.,passing... (beacon);,... (radial I DME)FROM...;,executing radar turns VOR radial \/ DME... FROM... (STATION).,1.6.1.2 The application of radar control service,1.6.1.2.1. Radar identification is achieved according to the provisions specified by ICAO.,1.6.1.2.2. Radar control service is provided in controlled airspace to aircraft operating within the Lusaka and LivingstoneTMA. This service may include:,radar separation of arriving, departing and en-route traffic;,radar monitoring of arriving, departing and en-route traffic to provide information on any significant deviation from the nominal flight path;,radar vectoring when required;,assistance to aircraft in emergency;,assistance to aircraft crossing controlled airspace;,warnings and position information on other aircraft considered to constitute a hazard;,information to assist in the navigation of aircraft;,information on observed weather;,radar watch when required.,1.6.1.2.3. The minimum horizontal radar separations are:,5NM within Radar coverage,As specified by the appropriate Authority.,1.6.1.2.4. Levels assigned by the radar controller to pilots will provide a minimum terrain clearance according to the phase of flight.,1.6.1.3 ATS surveillance system and radio failure procedures,1.6.1.3.1 Radar failure,In the event of radar failure or loss of radar identification, instructions will be issued to restore non-radar standard separation and the pilot will be instructed to communicate with the parent ATS unit.,1.6.1.3.2 Radio failure,1.6.1.3.2.1. The radar controller will establish whether the aircraft radio receiver is working by instructing the pilot to carry out a turn or turns. If the turns are observed, the radar controller will continue to provide radar service to the aircraft.,1.6.1.3.2.2. If the aircraft's radio is completely unserviceable, the pilot should carry out the procedures for radio failure in accordance with ICAO provisions. If radar identification has already been established, the radar controller will vector other identified aircraft clear of its track until such time as the aircraft leaves radar coverage.,1.6.1.4 Graphic portrayal of area of radar coverage,Since the area of radar coverage is identical to that of SSR, see ENR 1.6.2.4 - Graphic portrayal of area of coverage of radar\/SSR.,1.6.2 Secondary surveillance radar (SSR),1.6.2.1 Emergency procedures,1.6.2.1.1. Except when encountering a state of emergency, pilots shall operate transponders and select modes and codes in accordance with ATC instruction. In particular, when entering Lusaka FIR, pilots who have already received specific instructions from ATC concerning the setting of the transponder shall maintain that setting until otherwise instructed.,1.6.2.1.2. Pilots of aircraft about to enter Lusaka FIR who have not received specific instructions from ATC concerning the setting of the transponder shall operate the transponder on Mode A\/3, Code 24 (or 2400) before entry and maintain that code setting until otherwise instructed.,1.6.2.1.3. If the pilot of an aircraft encountering a state of emergency has previously been directed by ATC to operate the transponder on a specific code, this code setting shall be maintained until otherwise advised.,1.6.2.1.4. In all other circumstances, the transponder shall be set to Mode A\/3, Code 77 (or 7700). Notwithstanding the procedure in 1.6.2.1.1 above, a pilot may select Mode A\/3, Code 77 (or 7700) whenever the nature of the emergency is such that this appears to be the most suitable course of action.,Continuous monitoring of responses on Mode A\/3, Code 77 is provided.,1.6.2.2 Radio communication failure and unlawful interference procedures,1.6.2.2.1 Radio communication failure procedure,In the event of an aircraft radio receiver failure, a pilot shall select Mode A\/3, Code 76 (or 7600) and follow established procedures; subsequent control of the aircraft will be based on those procedures.,1.6.2.2.2 Unlawful interference procedure,Pilots of aircraft in flight subjected to unlawful interference shall endeavour to set the transponder to Mode A, Code 7500 to make the situation known, unless circumstances warrant the use of Mode A\/B, Code 77 (or 7700).,1.6.2.3 System of SSR Code assignment,CATEGORY,LUSAKA (FLKK),LIVINGSTONE(FLHN),REMARKS,International,5500,5557,5561,5577,INTERNATIONAL &amp; FIR,Domestic 1,5600,5657,5660,5677,DOMESTIC TMA,Domestic 2,5700,5757,5760,5777,DOMESTIC FIR,Others,5200,5257,5260,5277,MICROLIGHT &amp; HELICOPTER,1.6.2.4 Graphic portrayal of area of coverage of radar\/SSR,TO BE DEVELOPED,","279");
