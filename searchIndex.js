The aeronautical information is provided in the form of the Aeronautical Information Products consisting of the following:,-,-,-,-,-,-,Aeronautical information Publication (AIP),Amendment Service to the AIP (AIP AMDT);,Supplement to the AIP (AIP SUP);,NOTAM and Preflight Information Bulletins (PIB);,Aeronautical Information Circulars (AIC); and,Checklist and list of valid NOTAMs,A checklist of AIP pages containing page number\/chart title and the publication of effective date (day, month by name and year) of the information is reissued with each amendment and is an integral part of the AIP.,3.2 Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP),The AIP is the basic aviation document intended primarily to satisfy international requirements for the exchange of permanent aeronautical information and temporary changes of long duration essential for air navigation.,AIP Zambia is published in one volume. The AIP is published in a loose-leaf form in English only for use in international and domestic operations of all types of flight.,3.3 Amendment service to the AIP (AIP AMDT),Amendments to the AIP are made by means of replacement sheets. Two types of AIP AMDT are produced:,-regular AIP Amendment (AIP AMDT), issued in accordance with the established regular interval (ref. GEN ...) and identified by a light blue coversheet, incorporates permanent changes into the AIP on the indicated publication date; and,AIRAC AIP Amendment (AIRAC AIP AMDT), issued in accordance with the,AIRAC system and identified by a pink cover sheet and the acronym,NOTE,:AIRAC, incorporates operationally significant permanent changes into the AIP on the indicated AIRAC effective date.,A brief description of the subjects affected by the amendment is given on the AIP Amendment cover sheet. New information included on the reprinted AIP pages is annotated or identified by a vertical line in the left margin (or immediately to the left) of the change\/addition.,Each AIP page and each AIP replacement page introduced by an amendment, including the amendment cover sheet, are dated. The date consists of the day, month (by name) and year of the publication date (regular AIP AMDT) or of the AIRAC effective date (AIRAC AIP AMDT) of the information. Each AIP amendment cover sheet includes references to the serial number of those elements, if any, of theAeronautical Information Products which have been incorporated in the AIP by the amendment and are consequently cancelled.,Each AIP AMDT and each AIRAC AIP AMDT are allocated separate serial numbers which are consecutive and based on the calendar year. The year, indicated by two digits, is a part of the serial number of the amendment, e.g. AIP AMDT 1\/96; AIRAC AIP AMDT 1\/96.,A checklist of AIP pages containing page number\/chart title and the publication or effective date (day, month by name and year) of the information is reissued with each amendment and is an integral part of the AIP.,3.4 Supplement to the AIP (AIP SUP),Temporary changes of long duration (three months and longer) and information of short duration which consists of extensive text and\/or graphs, supplementing the permanent information contained in the AIP, are published as AIP Supplements (AIP SUP).,AIP Supplements are separated by information subject (General - Gen, EN-Route _ENR and Aerodromes - AD) and are placed accordingly at the beginning of each AIP part. Each AIP supplement is allocated a serial number which is consecutive and based on the calendar year, i.e AIP SUP 1\/03.,An AIP Supplement is kept in the AIP as long as all or some of its contents remain valid. The period of validity of the information contained in the AIP Supplement will normally be given in the supplement itself. Alternatively NOTAM may be used to indicate changes to the period of validity or cancellation of the supplement.,The check list of AIP supplements currently in force is issued in the monthly printed plain language summary of NOTAM in force.,3.5 NOTAM and Pre-flight Information Bulletins (PIB),NOTAM contain information concerning the establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures or hazard the timely knowledge of which is essential for personnel concerned with flight operations. The text of each NOTAM contain the information in the order shown in the ICAO NOTAM Format and is composed of the significations\/uniform abbreviated phraseology assigned to the ICAO NOTAM Code complemented by ICAO abbreviations, indicators, identifiers, designators, call signs, frequencies, figures and plain language. NOTAM are originated and issued for Lusaka FIR and are distributed in three series identified by the letters A,B and C.,Series A. General rules, en-route navigation and communication facilities, airspace restrictions and activities taking place within the FIR and information concerning major international aerodromes.,Series B. Information on the other International Airport\/Aerodrome.,Series C.

A radar unit normally operates as an integral part of the parent ATS unit and provides radar service to aircraft, to the maximum extent practicable, to meet the operational requirement. Many factors, such as radar coverage, controller workload and equipment capabilities, may affect these services, and the radar controller shall determine the practicability of providing or continuing to provide radar services in any specific case.,1.6.1.1.2. A pilot will know when radar services are being provided because the radar controller will use the following phraseology... (aircraft call signthis is ...Area\/Approach, radar identified\/or radar contact.,passing... (beacon);,... (radial I DME)FROM...;,executing radar turns VOR radial \/ DME... FROM... (STATION).,1.6.1.2 The application of radar control service,1.6.1.2.1. Radar identification is achieved according to the provisions specified by ICAO.,1.6.1.2.2. Radar control service is provided in controlled airspace to aircraft operating within the Lusaka and LivingstoneTMA. This service may include:,radar separation of arriving, departing and en-route traffic;,radar monitoring of arriving, departing and en-route traffic to provide information on any significant deviation from the nominal flight path;,radar vectoring when required;,assistance to aircraft in emergency;,assistance to aircraft crossing controlled airspace;,warnings and position information on other aircraft considered to constitute a hazard;,information to assist in the navigation of aircraft;,information on observed weather;,radar watch when required.,1.6.1.2.3. The minimum horizontal radar separations are:,5NM within Radar coverage,As specified by the appropriate Authority.,1.6.1.2.4. Levels assigned by the radar controller to pilots will provide a minimum terrain clearance according to the phase of flight.,1.6.1.3 ATS surveillance system and radio failure procedures,1.6.1.3.1 Radar failure,In the event of radar failure or loss of radar identification, instructions will be issued to restore non-radar standard separation and the pilot will be instructed to communicate with the parent ATS unit.,1.6.1.3.2 Radio failure,1.6.1.3.2.1. The radar controller will establish whether the aircraft radio receiver is working by instructing the pilot to carry out a turn or turns. If the turns are observed, the radar controller will continue to provide radar service to the aircraft.,1.6.1.3.2.2. If the aircraft's radio is completely unserviceable, the pilot should carry out the procedures for radio failure in accordance with ICAO provisions. If radar identification has already been established, the radar controller will vector other identified aircraft clear of its track until such time as the aircraft leaves radar coverage.,1.6.1.4 Graphic portrayal of area of radar coverage,Since the area of radar coverage is identical to that of SSR, see ENR 1.6.2.4 - Graphic portrayal of area of coverage of radar\/SSR.,1.6.2 Secondary surveillance radar (SSR),1.6.2.1 Emergency procedures,1.6.2.1.1. Except when encountering a state of emergency, pilots shall operate transponders and select modes and codes in accordance with ATC instruction. In particular, when entering Lusaka FIR, pilots who have already received specific instructions from ATC concerning the setting of the transponder shall maintain that setting until otherwise instructed.,1.6.2.1.2. Pilots of aircraft about to enter Lusaka FIR who have not received specific instructions from ATC concerning the setting of the transponder shall operate the transponder on Mode A\/3, Code 24 (or 2400) before entry and maintain that code setting until otherwise instructed.,1.6.2.1.3. If the pilot of an aircraft encountering a state of emergency has previously been directed by ATC to operate the transponder on a specific code, this code setting shall be maintained until otherwise advised.,1.6.2.1.4. In all other circumstances, the transponder shall be set to Mode A\/3, Code 77 (or 7700). Notwithstanding the procedure in 1.6.2.1.1 above, a pilot may select Mode A\/3, Code 77 (or 7700) whenever the nature of the emergency is such that this appears to be the most suitable course of action.,Continuous monitoring of responses on Mode A\/3, Code 77 is provided.,1.6.2.2 Radio communication failure and unlawful interference procedures,1.6.2.2.1 Radio communication failure procedure,In the event of an aircraft radio receiver failure, a pilot shall select Mode A\/3, Code 76 (or 7600) and follow established procedures; subsequent control of the aircraft will be based on those procedures.,1.6.2.2.2 Unlawful interference procedure,Pilots of aircraft in flight subjected to unlawful interference shall endeavour to set the transponder to Mode A, Code 7500 to make the situation known, unless circumstances warrant the use of Mode A\/B, Code 77 (or 7700).,1.6.2.3 System of SSR Code assignment,CATEGORY,LUSAKA (FLKK),LIVINGSTONE(FLHN),REMARKS,International,5500,5557,5561,5577,INTERNATIONAL &amp; FIR,Domestic 1,5600,5657,5660,5677,DOMESTIC TMA,Domestic 2,5700,5757,5760,5777,DOMESTIC FIR,Others,5200,5257,5260,5277,MICROLIGHT &amp; HELICOPTER,1.6.2.4 Graphic portrayal of area of coverage of radar\/SSR,TO BE DEVELOPED,","649");

A situation in which, in the opinion of the pilot or the air traffic services personnel, the distance between aircraft, as well as their relative positions and speed, has been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. Aircraft proximity is classified as follows:,Risk of collision. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has existed.,Safety not assured. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised.,No risk of collision. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which no risk of collision has existed.,Risk not determined. The risk classification of aircraft proximity in which insufficient data was available to determine the risk involved, or inconclusive or conflicting evidence precluded such determination.,AIRPROX,.

In general, these are intended to provide protection for aircraft operating in low visibilities and to avoid disturbance of the ILS signals.,Protection of ILS signals during Category II and III operations may dictate that pre-take-off holding positions be more distant from the runway than the holding positions used in good weather. Such holding positions will be appropriately marked and will display signs conforming to specification on ICAO Annex 14, Volume 1, on one or both sides of the taxiway; there may also be a stop bar of red lights. For aircraft taxiing off the runway during Category III operations, exit taxiway centre line lights are colour -coded to facilitate notification of runway vacation: the colour coding ends at the boundary of ILS critical\/sensitive area. Pilots are required to make a \u201CRunway Vacated\u201D call on RTF when the aircraft has reached the colour code of part of the exit taxiway centre line lights, due allowance being made for aircraft size to ensure that the entire aircraft is clear of the ILS critical\/sensitive area.,In actual Category II or III weather conditions, pilots will be informed by ATC of any unserviceabilities in the promulgated facilities so that they can amend their minima, if necessary, according to their operations manual. Pilots who wish to carry out a practice Category II (or Category III) approach on initial contact with Approach Control. For practice approaches there is no guarantee that the full safeguarding procedures will be applied and pilots should anticipate the possibility of a resultant ILS signal disturbance.,AD 1.1.4 Aerodrome operating minima,For the friction measuring devices used.
